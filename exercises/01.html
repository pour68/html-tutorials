        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on
        the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
        have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices

    <h4>SASS</h4>
    <p>
        Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or
        compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.
